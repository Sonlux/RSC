# 🚧 Real-time Pothole Detection System (RSC)

This project is a real-time pothole detection system powered by an ESP32 microcontroller, an OV2640 camera, and a lightweight TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model. It is designed for embedded road monitoring applications where edge-based inference is necessary for fast and reliable detection.

---

## 📌 Features

- Real-time image classification using a CNN model
- Deployed on ESP32-WROOM-32E microcontroller
- Captures images using the OV2640 camera
- TensorFlow Lite model inference directly on the device
- Works offline, no internet required
- Compact and power-efficient design

---

## 🔧 Hardware Used

- ESP32-WROOM-32E
- OV2640 Camera Module
- I2S Microphone (optional for future audio integration)
- Breadboard, jumper wires, and supporting components

---

## 💻 Software and Tools

- Arduino IDE
- Python (for model training)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- TensorFlow Lite Converter
- `xxd` (to convert `.tflite` to `.cc` for embedding)
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sonlux/RSC.git
cd RSC
```

### 2. Set Up Arduino IDE

- Install ESP32 board support in Board Manager
- Add the following libraries:
  - `ESP32`
  - `esp_camera`
  - `TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers`

### 3. Upload Code to ESP32

- Open `src/main.cpp` in Arduino IDE
- Connect your ESP32 via USB
- Select the correct COM port and board
- Click Upload

### 4. Convert the TFLite Model (If needed)

```bash
xxd -i model/pothole_detector.tflite > src/pothole_model.cc
```

---

## 🧠 Model Training

- Dataset includes images of roads with and without potholes
- CNN model trained using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model is quantized and converted to TensorFlow Lite
- Designed to run with minimal RAM/Flash footprint

---

## 📸 Demo

Potholes are detected live as the ESP32 processes camera input. Output can be visualized via serial logs, alerts, or future integration with a web dashboard or mobile app.
